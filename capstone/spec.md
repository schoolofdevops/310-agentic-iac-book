# Capstone Spec: Storage and Config Layer for a Small Web App

## Intent

A small internal web app needs a storage and config layer: a place to keep uploaded
user files, and a place to keep per-environment config values the app reads at
startup. This is the same kind of ask M01's lab and M07's lab used, capstone-sized:
three real resources, one deliberate gap for the pipeline to catch.

## Requirements

- FR-001: An S3 bucket for user-uploaded files, versioned, so a bad upload can be
  rolled back
- FR-002: The bucket blocks public access at the bucket level
- FR-003: A DynamoDB table for app config, one row per environment, on-demand billing
- FR-004: Every resource carries `Environment`, `Owner`, and `ManagedBy` tags
- FR-005: No credential or access key anywhere in the module as a `default`

## Constraints

- CN-001: `aws` provider pinned to `~> 6.0`, matching `labs/shared/floci-spike/provider.tf`
- CN-002: No resource in this module may be a delete-capable dependency of another
  module. This module stands alone
- CN-003: Total managed resource count stays under 5 (the capstone's own blast-radius
  gate threshold)

## Acceptance criteria

- SC-001: `terraform fmt -check` and `terraform validate` both pass
- SC-002: `checkov` reports zero failures on `CKV_AWS_18` (bucket versioning) and
  `CKV_AWS_53`/`CKV_AWS_54`/`CKV_AWS_55`/`CKV_AWS_56` (public access block), and zero
  `CKV_SECRET_*` findings
- SC-003: `trivy config` reports zero HIGH/CRITICAL findings within this spec's own
  scope (versioning, public access, secrets). A real, separate `AWS-0132`
  (bucket not encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key) finding is expected to
  remain: fixing it would add a KMS key resource and push this module past its
  own CN-003 resource-count limit. This is deliberate, the same honest-gap lesson
  M07 and M08 taught: a scanner is a permanent gate, not a one-time checklist a
  spec can fully close
- SC-004: The capstone's own OPA/Conftest policy (every resource has `Environment`,
  `Owner`, `ManagedBy`) passes
- SC-005: The blast-radius hook passes (no deletes, resource count ≤ 5, no
  high-radius resource types)
- SC-006: `terraform apply` succeeds against Floci; `terraform destroy` leaves no
  orphaned state
